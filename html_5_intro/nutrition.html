        <h2>The Role of Nutrition in Health</h2>
        <hr>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Nutrition is a foundational aspect of health and wellness. A balanced diet provides the essential nutrients that our bodies need to function effectively. Consuming a variety of foods including fruits, vegetables, proteins, and whole grains supports energy levels, promotes growth and repair, and strengthens the immune system. Incorporating diverse nutrients also helps to prevent chronic diseases.</p>

            <p>In addition to macronutrients, micronutrients like vitamins and minerals play a significant role in health. Foods rich in these nutrients enhance cognitive function, protect against inflammation, and maintain cellular health. Following guidelines for balanced nutrition can make a notable difference in oneâ€™s overall quality of life.</p>
