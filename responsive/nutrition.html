        <h2>The Role of Nutrition in Health</h2>
        <hr>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Nutrition is a foundational aspect of health and wellness, directly impacting energy, mood, and overall bodily functions. A balanced diet consisting of a variety of foods provides the necessary nutrients for growth, repair, and maintaining optimal health. The foods you consume play a critical role in reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity.</p>
            <p>By understanding the nutrients your body needs, you can make informed food choices that support your personal health goals, whether they include weight management, muscle growth, or overall well-being.</p>

            <h3>Understanding Macronutrients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> The body's main source of energy. Carbs can be simple or complex. Simple carbs (sugars) provide quick energy, while complex carbs (e.g., whole grains) provide long-lasting energy. It's essential to choose healthy, fiber-rich carbs like brown rice, oats, and legumes.</li>
                <li><strong>Proteins:</strong> Essential for muscle repair, immune function, and the production of enzymes and hormones. Lean meats, fish, eggs, beans, and nuts are excellent protein sources that support growth and recovery.</li>
                <li><strong>Fats:</strong> Vital for hormone production, brain function, and energy. Opt for healthy fats like those found in avocados, olive oil, and fatty fish, which are rich in omega-3 fatty acids that support heart health.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="micronutrients">
            <h3>Micronutrients and Their Importance</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vitamins:</strong> Support various bodily functions such as immune defense, wound healing, and energy production. Vitamin C (found in citrus fruits) helps boost immunity, while Vitamin D (from sunlight and fortified foods) aids in calcium absorption.</li>
                <li><strong>Minerals:</strong> Essential for maintaining healthy bones, teeth, and cells. Calcium (found in dairy and leafy greens) strengthens bones, while magnesium helps in muscle and nerve function.</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Plant-Based Diet:</strong> Focuses on plant-derived foods such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains. It can reduce the risk of chronic diseases and improve digestion.</li>
