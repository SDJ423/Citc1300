        <p>Health and wellness encompass a balanced approach to physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Regular physical activity, a nutrient-rich diet, and sufficient rest are essential for maintaining energy levels, improving mental clarity, and reducing the risk of chronic diseases. Simple daily practices like a morning walk, stretching, and drinking water can positively impact your health over time. Wellness is not only about fitness but involves self-awareness, goal-setting, and developing habits that foster resilience, positivity, and a sustainable lifestyle.</p>
        <p>Aside from physical health, mental wellness is crucial in overall well-being. Practicing mindfulness, setting healthy boundaries, and nurturing social connections can contribute significantly to mental resilience. Engaging in activities that bring joy or relaxation, such as reading, painting, or journaling, helps maintain mental balance. Additionally, quality sleep is fundamental for mental and physical health. Adults should aim for 7-8 hours of sleep each night to promote cognitive function, emotional regulation, and overall physical repair.</p>
